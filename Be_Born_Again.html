        <article class="mt-5"><p>We live in a very crazy world where people put all there faith in riches and care
            nothing for their fellow man. People have become selfish, in every way breaking God's laws and then
            wondering why their life is in such a mess. It breaks God's heart to see people suffer with sickness and
            poverty or to see anyone tormented in their mind with worry and dispair fearful of what is to come. Jesus
            said <span class="text-danger">I have come to give you life more abundantly John 10:10</span>. Jesus came
            and broke the hold that satan had on the people of the world for so many centuries because of the sin of
            Adam and Eve. He became the blood sacrifice for your sins before God the Father so you could become
            righteous, pure and clean, a true child of God but it's not automatic you must claim it for yourself.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="mt-5"><p>But we are all as filthy rags before God. We are born into sin which is like a horrible
            smell that we can't wash away. We need a substitute, a Savior to make you clean before God so that you may
            enter Heaven. Jesus came and took upon himself this very task so that YOU could be born into the family of
            God, clean from sin.</p></article>

        <article class="mt-5 ms-5 me-5 text-center fst-normal"><p>Jesus said: <span class="text-danger">Except a man be born again he can never see the kingdom of Heaven. John 3:3I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. John 14:6</span>
            But as many as received him, (Jesus) to them gave he power to become the sons of God,even to them that
            believe on his name. John 1:12</p></article>
