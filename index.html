            to you fellow Human and Welcome. The purpose of this website is to give you the oportunity to hear the real,
            honest truth about the God of the Bible and to gain a clear understanding of who the God of Heaven really is
            and how wonderful your life could be if you will listen and then join his family through his Son Jesus so
            you can become a true child of God. The God of the King James Bible has been badly represented by religious
            organizations and many lies have been told about him for he is loving, kind, merciful, forgiving and NOT an
            angry God. He does NOT take pleasure in hurting or killing or destroying for satan your greatest enemy is
            responsible for all the evil that happens to you. Most people are very mislead about God since they blindly
            follow a false religion preaching a false doctrine that tickles their ears and hightens their emotions
            sending millions to Hell. They don't realize they have been decieved until it is too late. This is why it is
            so important that you understand the truth now. This world has gone completely crazy and is headed for total
            destruction. But you can be in the hands of God and change your life into a blessed, happy, God protected
            life without any fears or worries and have total confidence that God is watching over you and your family
            and he will never leave you ever. God can not lie or he wouldn't be God. He has made promises he will keep.
            People who don't have Jesus are open targets for satan and his demons to destroy.</p>

         <p class="my-5">God has been lied about so badly by TV preachers, prophets, priests, pastors, cults,
            guru's, and so called holy men. God operates on this Earth by his own ways apart from our understanding for
            his ways are always perfect and right. God wants you to know his truth and to erase your past and forgive
            you of ALL of your sins, give you a place in Heaven and show you how to start your life again, fresh and new
            with him. He is a God of second chances. It is God's greatest desire that everyone would be <a
                    href="Be_Born_Again.html">born again</a> through his Son Jesus and not perish in the flames of Hell.
            God has a great love for you but he won't force you to listen to him since he gave all of us a free will of
            our own to choose between good and evil. He wants to give you a new heart of love with a sound and clear
            understanding mind no matter who you are or how unworthy you may feel you are. We at the Shield of Faith
            wish only to help and encourage you to make a fresh new start today. We wish to help you by exposing all of
            these lies that news media, churches and cult religions in this world have told you so that you can be free
            to live a wonderful, abundant and peaceful life on this Earth and know your creator as Father and best
            friend. God <u>can never</u> be found through a religion but only by a personal relationship with God as
            your Father and Jesus as your Savior and redeemer. Many have tried other ways and have failed.</p> 

        <p class="my-5">Many people ask: <strong>"Why doesn't God help me?" "Why does God allow so much
            suffering in the world?"</strong> There is only one truthful explanation to this. All through history
            everything that we have allowed that has been against the teachings of the Bible God gave us has brought
            about terrible consequences. So why do people blame God for all the evil and suffering in the world when it
            is <u>we ourselves</u> that are responsible for allowing these terrible things to happen. We allow abortion,
            removal of prayer and Bibles from schools, pornography, we publicially curse God with evolution, occult
            practices and everything else he calls evil. We no longer build into ourselves any personal honor, honesty,
            pride or self integrity but instead we lie, decieve, steal and kill. You must understand that there are only
            two families on this Earth today, God's family and Satans. So if you are not born again into God's family
            then he can not hear your prayers or help you in your life for he is holy and perfect and will not allow sin
            in his presence. Infact those that do not have the Son of God Jesus don't have life but the wrath of God
            abides on them. 1 John 5:12. The people of the world have been blinded to the truth. God the Father is here
            right now watching and listening to your heart and mind.</p>

        <p class="my-5">He wants to help you so your life can change into a glorious life beyond what you could
            even imagine but you must do it his way not yours. The God of the Bible that sits in Heaven made each of us
            very special from his heart and he says he loves you more than his entire creation. He wants for you and
            your family and all those you love to know him personally, be healthy, happy, strong minded, protected and
            blessed all of the days of your life for this is his plan for you. God is not distant but a real person just
            like you not fictional or imaginary but rea and God wants to reveal himself to you today. God is knocking on
            the door of your heart asking you to let him come in. But you must make the choice yourself.</p>

        <p class="my-5">Satan is the one, who has given mankind all sorts of evil thoughts and ideas like cult
            religions full of ritual and traditional nonsense for God is NOT involved in ANY of the religions that you
            see in the world today for he says they are an insult and an abomination to him. Religions are totally man
            made used to control and confuse people from the truth. People have believed these lies only because they
            have not seen God with their eyes or heard him speak to them so they try a religion hoping to reach God and
            better their lives performing rituals while in truth they are all of a satanic origin and do nothing but
            destroy peoples lives. People will become so involved in them they literally will give their wealth, loyalty
            and life to defend these false doctrines not realizing they are wrong until it's too late. God is offering
            you the truth today so you can be free from all the fear, worry, anxiety, torment and lack that you may be
            experiencing right now.</p>

        <p class="my-5">Right now in this century the world is living in the latter part of the Age of Grace
            which began the day Jesus died. God has given man time to repent and to receive Jesus as Savior but man's
            time is about over. We now enjoy so many technological wonders like computers, cars, cell phones, great
            medical knowledge and live in beautiful homes with all the comforts that no previous generation of people
            before us could ever have dreamed of. God has chosen this century as the time for all of this knowledge to
            be revealed to man but all of this is not going to last. Soon this age of grace will come to a close since
            man has become very sinful and vile with this knowledge and extremely selfish worshipping other Gods such as
            money, possetions,, prestige, pride, power and glory forgetting that God has warned us that these will only
            bring destruction to our lives. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gains the whole world, and loses
            his own eternal soul? Mark 8:36.</p>

        <p class="my-5">We have murdered millions of babies in the womb, we have become greedy, prideful,
            loving wealth and will betray family, friends or anyone who gets in our way. We have become more evil than
            any generation before us and very soon the second coming of Jesus will happen just as all the other
            prophecies in the Bible that have come true. The world is on the verge of a great taking away when suddenly
            millions of babies, children and people will go missing in a flash of time and then the world will become a
            horrible economic disasterous place with rioting, looting, stealing, killing and running to survive. Yes
            this is the real truth and you can be saved from all of this and be ready when Jesus comes to take those
            that have joined the family of God. Your life can change and become wonderful no matter who you are or what
            country you live in. The choice is yours now to decide then hear this message and respond to God. He is here
            waiting to speak with you right now. Satan is also here and he will whisper into your ear not to listen to
            this message to forget this.. Satan will try to stop you from choosing God's offer......... Don't listen to
            him. Make a leap of faith today.</p>
