            <p>The news media and college professors have so badly polluted young peoples minds and taught them lies
                about mans beginnings, past history of the earth, stars and planets, their orgins and life itself. But
                Kent Hovind using God's word will enhance your mind and demonstrate the truth about all of this. Knowing
                the true history of how you were made and why you are here is very important. In his videos Kent Hovind
                gives proof in a detailed account of why the world is in such a terrible mess and how to avoid those
                pitfalls. Do you have a hunger to know the truth or do you want to just continue in ignorance, stumbling
                through life as you have been? God wants you to know the power of the truth about everything. Download
